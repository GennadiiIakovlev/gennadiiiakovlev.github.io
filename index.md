I am a post-doctoral fellow specializing in introducing large language models (LLMs) to solve political science questions. I am based in Budapest, now at Center for Social Studies, ELTE; previously a postdoctoral fellow in Democracy Institue, GFDD Programme, Colombo Hub, and in the Institute for Advance Study, CEU.  

I received my PhD in Political Science from the European University Institute. I taught classes on large language models and on regime change at the Bard College, HHU Düsseldorf,  TU Darmstadt, European University at Saint Petersburg, and University of Colombo. My dissertation traced the conditions under which pacted exits from authoritarian rule succeed, showing that the pathway depends on the organizational capacity of the opposition during negotiations.

My current project applies state-of-the-art LLM techniques to develop a novel measure of affective elite polarization—that is, how much parliamentary actors express in-group liking and out-group dislike. Using a corpus of European parliamentary speeches from the past two decades, the LLM identifies when politicians criticise or praise one another, interprets the surrounding context, and explains the cues it relied on. The goal is an EU-wide, publicly available database (and eventually a global index) of elite affective polarization, accompanied by an interactive website with visualization tools.
