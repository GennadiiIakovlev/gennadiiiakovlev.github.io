* **(De-)politicization in authoritarian contexts: a
state - civil society perspective** --
Francesca Chiarvesio--postdoctoral fellow at the University of Bern--and I set out to understand whether Russia’s flagship Presidential Grants programme rewards civil-society organisations (CSOs) for echoing the Kremlin’s conservative, patriotic rhetoric. We scraped roughly 150,000 project applications (successful and unsuccessful) submitted between 2017 and 2024, linked them to organisational data, and then used large-language-model coding plus fixed-effects logistic regression to see which factors actually predict who gets funded. Along the way we built novel scales, including a 0-to-4 “patriotic-values” index and an estimated age of each project’s target group, to capture the ideological and demographic texture of CSO demands.

The headline finding upends a decade of conventional wisdom. Once we control for project quality, organisational experience and region, greater engagement with patriotic or traditionalist language does not improve, and sometimes even slightly hurts, an application’s chances of winning money. Instead, what matters most are performance-oriented signals: prior grant-management success, a credible web presence, modest funding requests, and—crucially—being based in newly occupied Ukrainian territories, where grant flows surge as the state seeks quick legitimacy boosts. Even the post-2022 spike in CSO proposals to “indoctrinate” youth shows no corresponding bump in approvals; regime gatekeepers appear to value service delivery and reputational safety over overt ideological messaging.

These results suggest that what looks like depoliticisation from the outside is really a carefully managed politicisation of depoliticisation. By channelling thousands of small, topic-specific grants toward apolitical, short-term welfare projects, the Kremlin cultivates the image of an efficient, benevolent provider while cordoning off bottom-up mobilisation around contentious cleavages such as the war or socio-economic inequality. In other words, Russia’s authoritarian legitimation strategy relies less on cultural conservatism than on a performance-based welfare bargain—one that keeps civil society busy, visible and grateful, yet safely distanced from transformative politics.
