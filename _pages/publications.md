## Using Large Language Models in Political Science  
*4-week intensive seminar*

[Download full syllabus ⇩](../assets/pdf/llm-syllabus.pdf){:target="_blank"}

**Course description.** Recent breakthroughs in NLP and the public release of powerful LLMs such as GPT-4 opened fresh avenues for automated text analysis in political science. Over four weeks we cover theory, hands-on applications, and ethical considerations, equipping students to design their own LLM-driven projects.  

**Learning outcomes.** By the end of the course students will be able to:  
1. Explain the architecture of modern LLMs and key NLP concepts.  
2. Distinguish major LLM techniques relevant to political text (classification, sentiment, topic modelling, entity recognition).  
3. Apply LLM tools to real-world corpora such as speeches or social-media posts.  
4. Critically evaluate reliability, validity, bias, and ethical risks of LLM output.  
5. Connect model results to substantive political-science theory.  
6. Design a research project that leverages an LLM to answer a social-science question.

## Regime Change: Democratization and Democratic Backsliding  
*4-day crash-course (15 × 90 min sessions)*

[Download full syllabus ⇩](../assets/pdf/regime-change-democratization-and-democratic-backsliding.pdf){:target="_blank"}

**Course description.** Why do some countries democratise while others slide back into authoritarianism? This intensive seminar surveys classic and cutting-edge scholarship on regime types, transitions, hybrid regimes, and the contemporary wave of backsliding.  

**Learning outcomes.** Participants will be able to:  
* recognise ideal-typical regimes and diagnose empirical cases;  
* apply theoretical frameworks to real-world country trajectories;  
* analyse the drivers of autocratic stability and democratic erosion;  
* critically engage with regime-change literature; and  
* estimate prospects for democratisation or backsliding.

## Low-Entry Barrier LLM Research Tools  
*Curated resource list for self-study*

[Download list ⇩](../assets/pdf/llm-low-entry.pdf){:target="_blank"}

This one-page guide collects high-yield primers, tutorials, and “vibe-coding” walkthroughs that help students jump-start LLM use without heavy coding prerequisites. Highlights include the FT’s interactive *Generative AI* explainer, 3Blue1Brown’s neural-network visualisation, and chain-of-density prompt engineering examples.

## Publications

### Journal articles

**Preconditions for Pacted Transitions** (European Political Science Review, 2022)  
This article investigates why some attempts at pacted transitions from non-democratic rule fail while others succeed. Drawing on a new dataset of 45 negotiation attempts, a fuzzy-set QCA shows that successful democratizing pacts are those where the opposition has strong organisational capacity, often supplied by nationwide trade unions or the Catholic Church. ([gennadiiiakovlev.netlify.app](https://gennadiiiakovlev.netlify.app/publication/preconditions-for-pacted-transitions/))  

**From Partnerships to Bureaucracies: The Constitutional Evolution of Russian Universities** (*Voprosy Obrazovaniya / Educational Studies Moscow*, 2018, with M. Sokolov & S. Lopatina)  
Treating universities as miniature political systems, the study analyses 400 charters and statutes to map three constitutional axes—founder independence, collegiality, and federalisation—and shows how their combinations generate distinct intra-university regime types. ([ideas.repec.org](https://ideas.repec.org/a/nos/voprob/2018i3p120-145.html))  

### Dissertation

**With Whom Should They Make the Pact? Preconditions for Pacted Transitions** (PhD thesis, European University Institute, 2021)  
Using a mixed-methods design, the dissertation explains when negotiations between autocrats and oppositions end in democratisation. It identifies organisationally strong oppositions as the decisive enabling factor and illustrates paths to success and failure through paired case studies of the 2004 and 2014 Ukrainian revolutions.
