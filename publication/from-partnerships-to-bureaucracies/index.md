abstract: "Russian university is treated as a miniature political
  system in this article. Four hundred charters, statutes and ordinances are
  analyzed in order to identify three pivotal axes allowing us to classify
  constitutional frameworks of universities: the axis of independence from the
  principal the axis of collegiality, or the balance of power between the rector
  and the Academic Council and the axis of federalization, which shows how
  decentralized the organizational structure is. Next, it is shown how these
  variables are interrelated and how their stable sets form types of
  intra-university political systems — federative, unitary, dual and controlled
  — which exist or used to exist in Russia. Contrary to the widely held belief
  that all of the differences between universities can be traced to their
  position on the scale of “collegiality” (partnership model) vs.
  “managerialism” (bureaucratic model) and although public universities do
  resemble bureaucracies more than partnerships today, different elements of
  their constitutional design seem to have evolved independently and under the
  influence of different factors."
