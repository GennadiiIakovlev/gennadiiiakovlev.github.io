abstract: "This paper investigates why some attempts at pacted transitions from
  non-democratic rule fail, while others succeed. It determines the composition
  of opposition organizations that enable pacting. The paper draws on a data set
  compiled by the author comparing forty-five attempts at negotiations. The QCA
  analysis shows that only those negotiations that include the opposition with
  strong organizational capacity succeed and end up with democratization. This
  strong organizational power of the opposition can be drawn from trade unions
  or The Catholic Church participating in negotiations, even if the initial
  regime is personalistic. "
