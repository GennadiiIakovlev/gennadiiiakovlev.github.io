abstract: "This course seeks to shed light on some of the fundamental questions
  occupying the minds of political scientists around the world. Why are some
  countries democracies while others are not? How do dictatorships work? What
  undermines autocratic rule? Which countries are ready for democracy? Why do
  some countries hold competitive elections, but remain autocratic? How can we
  then distinguish between democracy and dictatorship?  Finally, what is
  democratic backsliding and why does it happen? "
