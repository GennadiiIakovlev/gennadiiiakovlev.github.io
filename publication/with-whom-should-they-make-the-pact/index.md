abstract: "This dissertation investigates why some attempts at pacted
  transitions from non-democratic rule fail while others succeed. Using a
  mixed-methods design, the research determines the composition and
  characteristics of opposition organizations that enable pacting. The thesis
  draws on a data set compiled by the author comparing forty-five attempts at
  negotiations that resulted in three different outcomes: (1) an agreement was
  concluded, but one of the parties failed to comply with its provisions; (2) an
  agreement was concluded, and the parties followed through on the terms
  (successful negotiations), but it did not lead to democratization, and (3) an
  agreement was concluded, leading to democratization (a successful pact leading
  to democratization). The QCA analysis shows that almost always, only those
  negotiations that include an opposition with strong organizational capacity
  succeed and end up with democratization. In addition to the existing
  theoretical explanation that pacted transitions only happen in party regimes,
  my analysis shows that the strong organizational power of the opposition can
  be drawn from trade unions or the Church participating in negotiations, even
  if the initial regime is personalistic. All negotiations that included trade
  unions ended up with democracy. Likewise, all attempts at negotiations where
  the Church was present never failed, even if they did not always lead to
  democratization. The two paired comparisons using the most similar design
  approach show the two ways in which attempts at a pact can succeed (or fail).
  One path—shown by the paired comparison of the Tunisian and Egyptian
  revolutions during the Arab Spring) —indicates that the presence of a strong
  trade union can facilitate a successful pacted transition even when the rest
  of the opposition is poorly organized. The second path — exemplified through a
  paired comparison of the Ukrainian revolutions of 2004 and 2014 — indicates
  how the organizational capacity of the opposition movement can determine
  different outcomes even when the society and the interactions of actors are
  identical."
